# Student Performance Prediction

This repository contains a Decision Tree Regression model trained on a dataset of secondary school students, which includes various social, gender, and academic attributes. The goal is to predict students' final grades in Math based on a range of factors such as parental education, study time, extracurricular activities, and more. The dataset, sourced from [UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption), offers a rich context for understanding the influence of different variables on academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset includes comprehensive information categorized into the following groups:

- **Demographics**: Includes details like the student's school, age, sex, and family size.
- **Academic Factors**: Captures study time, past failures, grades, and other academic-related variables.
- **Social Factors**: Involves aspects like family relationships, free time, and social activities such as going out.
- **Health & Lifestyle**: Considers elements such as health status, alcohol consumption, and school absences.

## Usage

The Decision Tree Regression model can be utilized for both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to predict final grades based on various input features. It provides insights into how different factors contribute to students' academic outcomes, allowing for data-driven predictions and analyses.
